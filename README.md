# Matrix calculation thing

## project to create an app calculating properties of or using matrices

My first foray into typescript, this project started out as a simple matrix multiplication file in JS, but I decided to convert it to typescript, and have added many features onto it (it started out as only multiplication)

## Functions currently implemented:

- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Determinant calculation
- Matrix inverse (with built in validation)
- Matrix Trace calculation
- Rotation matrix creation based on angle
- Rotation of coordinate matrix from an angle(utilising prior function)
- Matrix addition/subtraction

## Functions planned to implement:

- Frontend
- matrix to calculate a shear
- Additional features could be considered on request
- Any other features I think of will be added if I can make them work
